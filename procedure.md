### Procedure

1. To apply input signal from various sources to the biosignal amplifier and observe the output of biosignal amplifier.
2. To change the gain of Amplifier and observe the change in output signal.
3. To record the output of biosignal amplifier with different gains and different inputs.
4. Plot the characteristic of biosignal amplifier.
5. To compare the output of simulated biosignal amplifier with the theoritical value.

**Go to the Simulator tab for performing the simulation.**
